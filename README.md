# Welcome to my repository

My name is Thanh Dat Tran, but you can just call me Ultimate. Currently, I am a third-year student at UEH University and my major is software engineering. I have learned a lot of programming languages such as C#, Java, Python, PHP, etc. My goal is to become a Web Developer with ASP.NET Core and Lavarel.
