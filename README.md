# Hello there

My name is Thanh Dat Tran, but you can call me Ultimate. Currently, I am a final-year student at UEH University and my major is Software Engineering. I have learned basic topics such as DSA, OOP, computing networking, OS, system design, data science, testing, git... and some advanced topics like A.I and cloud computing... I also learned some programming languages such as JS, C++, C#, Java, Python, and PHP. My goal is to become a Backend Developer with .NET.
